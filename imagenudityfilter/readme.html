What is this ?
==============
This class is a nudity filter for images. It tests whether
an image is nude or not. Currently It works with PNG, GIF
and JPG true colors pictures.


How does it work ?
===================
The idea of this class is to scan the image pixel by pixel
and test if the color of each pixel is between a human skin
color range, then it returns the percent of found pixels to
the number of pixels in the picture.
Before scanning we divide the picture into shapes;

    ---------------------------------
    |               1               |
    |   -------------------------   |
    |   |       |       |       |   |
    |   |   ----|       |----   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |   4   | 3 | 2 | 1 |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   |       |   |   |   |
    |   --------|       |--------   |
    |           |       |           |
    ---------------------------------

As long as you go into the middle of the picture, the color score
will be higher.
The idea behind this calculation; that almost all human pictures
are centered and focusing on the person who is in the picture.


Ideas for better scanning
=========================
- After marking a pixel as "skin" we see how many pixels meet together to
  create a "piece" of skin. But this calculation will take much memory and time.
  
- Instead of using one big color range, we split it into small ranges,
  Including the African skin colors range. But this will take much memory and time also.
  
- The class still needs a better color comparison to make sure that
  colors like the "Yellow" for example (which comes between the min and max
  color values of the human skin colors) will not be counted. I think this
  can be done if we compare Red, Green, and Blue values for the pixel color
  with the Red, Green, and Blue values for the min and max colors.


How to use this ?
=================
create an object from the class and call the ->GetScore() method giving
it the image file path, it will return the score in percentage value.
In my tests, When it says 30% or higher you should suspect the picture.

$filter = new ImageFilter;
echo 'My picture score is: ' . $filter->GetScore('mypicture.jpg');

For debugging, you can call the other fucntion ->GetScoreAndFill()
This will do the same as ->GetScore() but also will create a new picture
from the input picture and fill matched pixels with a new color.

$filter->GetScoreAndFill('mypicture.jpg', 'mypicture_filled.jpg');


Limitations
===========
- The success rate will not be high when using this class as it now,
  but I just wanted to share the idea cause I believe that in open source
  world, you will find thousands helping you to complete the job better
  than finishing it by only yourself.
  
- No calculations for African skin colors.

- No calculations for non true colors pictures (e.g. 256 colors).

- No calculations for animated GIF pictures


IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
PLEASE DO NOT TEST THIS CLASS WITH PORN PICTURES!
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS CLASS IS TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF PICTURES.
TO TEST THIS CLASS YOU CAN USE BABES PICTURES. AN EXAMPLE OF THESE
PICTURES THAT YOU CAN USE FOR TESTING, CAN BE FOUND AT:
